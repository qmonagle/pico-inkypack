The core functionality of this project is to take a random word from a list, and display it to the user every time a button is pressed. The target hardware is a raspbery pi pico connected to a pimoroni pico inky pack.

There are several other features planned, such as displaying battery percentage from an attached LiPo battery (with LiPo shim). I've already implemented these features with a micro python script, which works well. However, I wanted to re-implemnt everything in C++ as an extra challenge/practice.

I'm looking forward to adding featuers and refining the project over time.
